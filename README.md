# hello-world

Hi there!

I've loved computer my whole life as my dad always had a bunch of computers lying around the house.  I spent hours apon hours tinkering with them and my own to try and understand them.  At the time my Mom had a C++ for dummies book that she gave me to start coding back when I was still in grade school.  I remember going through the first few chapters, though, feelling very overwhelmed by it all. Eventually I did end up making a game but I don't remember much more that that.

After moving out of my parents house I got a callcenter job a a customer service representative and worked up to supervisor.  I lover leading others however the whole envirement just didn't feel suited for me.  

I spotted the "Desktop Engineer" position that opened up for the site I worked at and applied and GOT IT! I was very excited and fully enjoyed the work.  During my time there more and more became repetative as I felt I stopped learning new things.  All the while I really needed to make more money to have a less money stresed life and looking at other desktop positions in my city seamed to pay the same.  

1-2 skip a few and now I'm in back end IT programming cisco phones.  Definitely making more money but not feeling challened and I can smell automation happening in this position in a few years time. 

In the passed couple years I've learned quickly that the biggest things holding me back is the fear I won't be able to pull something off.  First it was with the supervisor position but in the end I could do it!  Then it was troubleshooting and computers but I ended up doing it as well.  No more fear. I'm going to tackle what I tried when I was in grade school, but this time I'm doing python.

Now I'm doing the 100 day coding challenge learning Python and I'm a week in. Already I feel I'm catching on drastically faster than I did back in the day. I feel more deteremined then I've felt about anyhting else. 

Action time.
